   <note>These photographs show a parade float made by supporters of the WCTU in Bristol, Tennessee. The women pictured range from the elderly to infants, all dressed in white, and one young boy is also on the float. Many of the women carry parasols, and two carry shepherd's tools. The first image may be of the women who were unable to ride on the float. The float itself is a large truck covered in white ruffles with a platform carrying a globe in its flatbed with the WTCU members. The Women's Christian Temperance Union (WTCU) was begun in Cleveland, Ohio in 1874 with an aim to implement the prohibition of alcohol. The WTCU had branches all over the United States, with the goal of "protection of the home."</note>
