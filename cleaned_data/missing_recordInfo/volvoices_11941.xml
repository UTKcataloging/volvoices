   <note>These images are of the renovated house which served as the director's residence when the National Soldiers Home operated at Mountain Home, Tennessee. Today, the area houses the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the James H. Quillen College of Medicine. Many of the historic buildings were still in use and remained well-preserved in 2007. The original construction style, a twist on Greek revival, was typical of a home built at the turn of the century, and the home included a grand interior stair and the application of exterior columns.</note>
