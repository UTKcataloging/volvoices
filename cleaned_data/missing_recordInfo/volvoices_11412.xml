   <note>This piece of sheet music is included in a bound volume that once belonged to Tennessee resident, Miss Nora Gardner. This particular piece was printed on the same page as "Over the Water to Charle." There is no publication date. However, it was most likely published during the range of 1848-1855, which has been inferred from the years during which the publisher operated under the specified name and location, as listed in the Handbook of Early American Sheet Music 1768-1889 by Harry Dichter and Elliott Shapiro (Dover, 1977).</note>
   <note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note>
