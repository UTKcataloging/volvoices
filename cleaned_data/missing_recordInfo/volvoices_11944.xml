One man stands behind them on the steps of the building, while another individual can be seen in the doorway. The second photograph is the Mess Hall where the waitresses worked at the National Soldiers Home. The Mess Hall now houses the Museum at Mountain Home. The dining hall at its maximum capacity served 2500 people per day, and often served produce grown on the Home's grounds.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0061_000050_000222_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11944</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11944/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
