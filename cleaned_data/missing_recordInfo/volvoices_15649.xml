   <note>This booklet enumerates the items for which the Tennessee League of Women Voters asked the legislature to support in the interest of women and children. Among the issues are the civil status of women, including property rights of married women; education - including minimum 9 months school terms, minimun salaries and competency requirements for teachers, mandatory physical education, free kindergarten, and the establishment of a vocational school for black girls; women in industry - establishment of a minimum wage and a Department of Labor, the abolishment of the convict lease system, improvement in working hours and conditions for working women, and equal pay for equal work; and additional items related to child welfare, social hygiene, temperance and conservation. It includes a list of the state, district and departmental chairpersons. The organization was called the Tennessee League of Women Voters at the time of publication.</note>
