The slogan, "The Voice of the Appalachians" is written on the cover. The contents of the pamphlet include praise for the station`s manager and owner, the progressive W.A. Wilson, who was credited with much of the success of the station. The pamphlet also includes the history of the station, pictures and information regarding the employees, the current station schedule and pictures of the studios. W.A.

The station was located in Bristol, Tennessee, but it served the surrounding areas in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina. In 1966 it was granted a dual city state license for Bristol, Tennessee-Virginia.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0085_000050_000223_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9999</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9999/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
