   <note>A legal Petition for Emancipation made by a slave (Sukey) who had been emancipated by the will of her deceased master, John Headon, for the faithful attention she had given to him, especially in his illness. According to the legal order granting her freedom, Sukey was "forever free with all her future posterity born or to be born since the death of her said master." A security in the amount of $1,000 was required. Edward Douglass, chairman of the court signed the order.</note>
