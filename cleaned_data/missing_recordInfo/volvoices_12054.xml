   <note>2 tifs. A photograph of Joseph Delaney seated in front of a fence lined with framed artwork, presumably his own. Delaney sits tenuously on the wooden crate, wearing a suit and hat, with papers in his left hand. The verso reads "To my friend Martha A. Singleton from Joseph Delaney, Oct 1934. 'Noted Individuals'." Joseph Delaney was one of Knoxville's best known artists. Delaney was nine of ten children whose father was a Methodist minister. He worked many odd jobs in Knoxville before leaving for Chicago in 1925 and New York in 1930. Delaney exhibited works in the first Washington Square Outdoor Art Show, and had many shows with prominent twentieth century artists including Jackson Pollack. Delaney died in 1991 in Knoxville.</note>
