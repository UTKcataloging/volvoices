   <note>3 tifs. Three scrip from Blount county, the first reads "Blount County Scrip--By Authority of law/ No. 2377/ The County of Blount/ Will pay Five Cents to bearer/ Maryville, Tenn., Jan. 6, 1862/ Will [unreadable], Chairman/ Receivable in Payment of County Taxes/ Haws and Dunkerly, Prs. Knoxville." On the left of the first scrip, Diana is drawn in hunting garb looking out to the horizon. At the center a St. Bernard holds a large key and sits next to a large safe on his left, and a child holding a caduceus. On the right of the scrip a deer leaps in the forest, away from Diana's gaze. The second scrip is a darker color, and contains much of the same text, including the same issuing signature, but is more text based, with the only image on the scrip being a train that runs across the top. This scrip was printed on December 16, 1862 and is for two dollars. The third scrip is also for two dollars, but was issued on January 6, 1862, and is mostly graphic--a woman sits with an eagle on a shield and holds a spear. The center of the image contains a large boat in the water, and again on the left a deer evades the spear of the more modern Diana. The more illustrated scrip were produced prior to Civil War battles in Tennessee, and the more simple scrip was produced after fighting had broken out in North and West Tennessee.</note>
