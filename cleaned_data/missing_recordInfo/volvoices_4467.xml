   <note>Reports that the first issue of the Bulletin as a radical paper took a half-hearted stand for the Republican party and made a poor showing. Observes that Tomeny`s personal debts and those owed by the Bulletin may cause it to fold financially. Warns that they still must strengthen the position of the Post through new features. Mention of debts owed by their paper; anticipates Coleman`s take over on the following day. Discloses that under pressure from Hamilton and on advice from Lewis, he nominated Hamilton as congressman-at-large.</note>
