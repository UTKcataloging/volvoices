   <note>In this WSM radio broadcast script, Representative Albert Gore of Tennessee describes the defeat of Civil Rights legislation in the Senate by a filibuster orchestrated by Southern senators. He also tells of the animosity present within the Democratic party, for Democratic senators from the East, North, and West resented the Southern senators spiteful efforts to oppose rent control in retaliation for their arduous fight against Civil Rights legislation. Gore reports Congressional discussion of the possibility that the Army is conducting too much "loose talking" and disapproves of the Air Corps` "costly publicity stunts."</note>
