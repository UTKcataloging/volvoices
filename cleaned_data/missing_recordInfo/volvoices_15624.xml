   <note>This two-sided broadside, compiled by the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, presents race-based arguments against the ratification of the 19th Amendment. One side reprints resolutions of the National Association of Colored Women`s Clubs from their convention in Tuskegee, Alabama in June, 1920. The other side warns of the possible passage of three Force Bills designed to force states to enforce the 14th Amendment along with the 19th Amendment, should the latter pass. It states that these bills would reverse the trend of the previous thirty years, in which 14th and 15th Amendments had been allowed to "rest lightly" upon the South. It claims that Southern manhood will defend Anglo-Saxon civilization and reject the Force bills to avoid reopening the wounds of Reconstruction.</note>
