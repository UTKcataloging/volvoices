   <note>This piece of sheet music is included in a bound volume that once belonged to Miss Nora Gardner, a Tennessee resident. This piece was published on the same page as "Oh, Dear, What Can The Matter Be." There is no publication date. However, this piece was most likely published during the years of 1848-1855, which has been inferred from the years during which the publisher operated under the specified name and location, as listed in the Handbook of Early American Sheet Music 1768-1889 by Harry Dichter and Elliott Shapiro (Dover, 1977).</note>
   <note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note>
