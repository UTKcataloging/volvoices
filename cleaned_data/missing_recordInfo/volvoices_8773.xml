   <note>This letter was written by the Assistant Industrial Agent in Johnson City, Tennessee, to the S [amp] F Manufacturing Company in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania. Apparently, women employees were dissatisfied and went on strike. The purpose of the letter was to generate interest for S [amp] F Manufacturing Company to move its business to Johnson City because the territory was almost unlimited and the mountain girls worked longer hours per day for less pay and would not be an embarrassment to the Company.</note>
