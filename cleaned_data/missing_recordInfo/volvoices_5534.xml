   <note>The Conquered Banner was written shortly after the Civil War and was extemely popular in the South and in the Catholic Church. It was nationally known and considered by many to be Abram`s finest work. The poem expreses Abram`s deep sorrow at the defeat of the Confederacy and is perhaps the most famous elegy ever written for the "Lost Cause" and its defenders. Father Abram served as a chaplain in the Confederate Army and was a priest in Clarksville, TN before coming to Knoxville, TN. The poem is thought to be written either in Clarksville or Knoxville, TN.</note>
