   <note>Three images depicting Memorial Day parades at the Mountain Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers at the Mountain Branch in Johnson City, Tennessee. The first aerial image depicts a float for "Coca-Cola" leading approximately a dozen other floats driving down a wooded drive. The picture is captioned: "May 30, 1938." The second image is of a building in downtown Johnson City decorated with the American flag and a banner for WJHL, which was a news source in Johnson City which started broadcasting television in 1953. The image shows a band in uniform and a local troop of Boy Scouts (possibly) passing. The third image, also captioned "May 30, 1938," is an aerial view of marching nurses in uniform with capes. The first and third images may be from the same photographer, as they have a similar view point.</note>
