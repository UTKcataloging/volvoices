   <note>2 tifs. Two photographs of the Knoxville Colored Orphanage and their board of directors. In the first photograph, the six member board of directors stands in front of a home, with James and Ethel Beck standing at either end of the group. The second image is a damaged photograph of a person interacting with animals, while a woman looks on outside a fence. It was taken of the farm at the orphanage. The children at the Knoxville Colored Orphanage attended public school and worked on-site at the orphanage. James and Ethel Beck were two of the most influential members of Knoxville's black community beginning in the 1920's. They helped to establish the Knoxville Colored Orphanage in 1919, and the project took off when Ethel was elected to head the board. In 1941 the school was re-named the Ethel Beck Home for Children in her honor, but closed in the early fifties.</note>
