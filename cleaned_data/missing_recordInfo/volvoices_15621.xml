One side contains an letter to Mrs. Catt from Mrs. James S. Pinkard, President of the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. Pinkard asks Catt to explain what she meant by statements such as "American women and men, white and black, should share equally in the privileges of democracy." She states that Tennessee legislators would violate their oaths if they vote to ratify the suffrage amendment, and demands the truth in this matter of "life and death" for the South. The other side reprints an article from The Woman Patriot, an anti-suffrage publication, which asserts that Catt defamed the United States by decrying the treatment of women with claims such as the fact that women cannot vote while aliens, illiterates, drunkards, paupers, criminals and the feeble-minded can vote.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0015_000051_000208_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A15621</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A15621/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
