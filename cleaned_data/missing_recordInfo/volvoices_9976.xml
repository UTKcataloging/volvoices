It describes the living conditions of a pregnant woman they provided care for outside of Sewanee, Tennessee. The woman lived in an old run-down cabin with her husband and 3 children, which was so dilapidated they had to use newspaper to insulate the cracks in the walls. Shortly after the woman reaches the hospital it is revealed that she has had a miscarriage.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0087_000051_000201_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9976</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9976/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
