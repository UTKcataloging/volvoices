Lays responsibility for the situation upon former Confederate commanders who are deceiving the state legislature. Urges that the legislature not be allowed to adjourn until provisions are made for the safety of loyal citizens. Foresees a conflict at the time of the November election when the issues of enfranchising former rebels and use of the state militia will be keenly felt.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0012_000053_000293_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12409</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12409/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
