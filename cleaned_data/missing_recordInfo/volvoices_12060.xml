Two images of African American students at the Green School in Knoxville. The first photograph depicts Green School students preparing for a parade outside the school. The first group of young students hold drums and instruments, the second set of students, some in safety patrol belts, hold signs that collectively say "Jack Sprat was like that he broke the rule of safely school so her he lies while ... cries." The last set of older students, well-dressed stand at the rear. The second image depicts pre-teen students in their seated in their desks in the classroom. The students smile for the camera as their teacher, Leon Nance, looks on. Green School is named for Dr. Henry M. Green and was established in 1909 on Payne Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee. Green School also served as Knoxville Colored High School from 1916 until 1928.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0073_000050_000239_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12060</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12060/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
