It outlined basic information about the curriculum and services of the Nashville city schools, highlighting improvements and recent developments and contained a financial report. The brochure cited the "challenges of modern times" as the reason for a "vigorous effort" to improve the schools. It mentioned improvements in facilities, materials, libraries, the number of male teachers, in foreign language, social studies, math and science instruction, the creation of new special education and vocational programs. It listed statistics on health contributions of school doctors and nurses, including home visits by school nurses. Per pupil expenditure was $310, compared with a national average of $390. Problems facing the district included adequate financing, extensive extracurricular duties of teachers, and the mobility of the student population. No mention was made of school desegregation, though it says that the "school population of Nashville is 56 per cent white and 44 per cent Negro."</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0015_000065_000202_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7515</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7515/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
