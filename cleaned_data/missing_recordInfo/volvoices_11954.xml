The Home originally included a four ward infirmary which was augmented after soldiers began to return after World War I. The Home was increased to help care for veterans suffering from lung scarring from gas attacks, tuberculosis and influenza. There are approximately 43 nurses pictured here, all in white uniforms. The nurses are standing on the steps of their residence, which was built in the Beaux-Arts style, common to the Mess Hall and other buildings on the grounds.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0061_000050_000229_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11954</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11954/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
