   <note>This piece of Confederate sheet music has "To Sister Nora from her Bro Will Crawford Miss Nov 14/64" inscribed in pencil along the top of the cover. The cover is an illustration of a Confederate soldier in a proper, pristine uniform holding a gun outfitted with a bayonet. Included in a bound volume of sheet music that was owned by Miss Nora Gardner of Tennessee. This song declares total and unswavering alliegance to the "noble boys who wear the suit of grey!"</note>
