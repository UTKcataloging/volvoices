Seawall and Dorothy Elizabeth Seawall. The main reason for the divorce appears to be religion. James Seawall was a Protestant while Dorothy Seawall was a Catholic. The mother and father of Dorothy are also listed as a cause, as James testified that Dorothy spent too much time at her mother`s house. F. E. Guerard testified that James Seawall complained in his letters that his wife neglected her "household duties." The case was filed on June 16, 1927 and the final decree was issued on November 22, 1927.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0024_000050_000200_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7945</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7945/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
