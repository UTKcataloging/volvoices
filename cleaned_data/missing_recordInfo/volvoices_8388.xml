   <note>From the first page of the pamphlet: "This pamphlet was prepared for publication as a part of a tour souvenir book in conjunction with the Sixth International Congress on Large Dams held September 16-19, 1958 in New York City. The Committee sponsored several `study tours` after the conclusion of the New York Congress. One of these tours was through the Southeastern United States and included inspection of certain of Alcoa`s hydroelectric developments as well as the hydroelectric developments of others." This pamphlet contains only the Alcoa portion of the souvenir book and "was prepared for distribution to members of the study tour, other visitors to Alcoa`s hydroelectric plants, and interested company personnel." The pamphlet was first published in February of 1958, reprinted in November 1958, and revised in January of 1973. 3 pages of 31.</note>
