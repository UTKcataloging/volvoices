   <note>A telegram sent from Richmond, Virginia to Memphis, Tennessee, which includes a first hand account of the Battle of Bull Run, the first major land battle of the Civil War. The Confederacy suffered losses of 387, Union of 460, with the Union army retreating, despite early gains in the battle. The telegram was sent by the South-Western Telegraph Company, and includes in the header the policies of the company, authorized by N. Green, the president in Louisville, Kentucky. It is assumed that the telegram was sent on an older page because the Battle of Bull Run took place on June 21, 1861.</note>
