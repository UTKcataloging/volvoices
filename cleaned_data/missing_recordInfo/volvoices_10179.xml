   <note>On the top right corner of the cover page of this piano ballad is an inscription written in pencil that reads "Presented to Nora by J. Frank Bell November 1859." The cover page of this piece that is included in a bound volume of sheet music once owned by Miss Nora Gardner, who was a resident of Tennessee, has an elaborate emobossed frame around the title.</note>
