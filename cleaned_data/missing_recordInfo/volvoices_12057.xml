Two class portraits from the Eastport School in 1957. The first photograph is of Teacher Marie Johnson's First Grade class. The group comprises nearly 45 African American students, assembled on the school's stairs and Ms. Johnson stands behind her students. The second image depicts a group of 28 sixth grade students at East Port School, with teacher Mrs. Macklin. Both photographs feature students standing in the front row with chalkboards with the grade and teacher written on them. Eastport School was established in 1905 on Fuller Avenue just outside the city limits of Knoxville, Tennessee. A new building for Eastport School was erected on Bethel Avenue in 1932.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0073_000050_000238_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12057</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12057/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
