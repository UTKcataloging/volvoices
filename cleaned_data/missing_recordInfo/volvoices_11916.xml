   <note>Major Paul Eave Divine, military officer and lawyer, was born in May 20, 1871. He worked as Treasurer under Walter P. Brownlow at the Mountain Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Mountain Home, Tennessee, near Johnson City in the first years of the home's operations. These images include a photograph of Major Divine, an organization chart of officers of the Mountain Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, and the house where Major Divine lived while serving as Treasurer. In addition to Divine, the chart lists the following officers: the Hon. Walter P. Brownlow, Local Manager; Col. John P. Smith, Governor; Major J.C. Butler, Surgeon; Captain W.E.F. Milburn, Quartermaster; Captain C.Y. Deadrick, Adjutant; Rev. Ruble, Chaplain and Father Larkin, Chaplain. The Mountain Branch "Old Soldiers Home" is now known as the James H.
