Two black and white photographs of the Rhea County Courthouse in Dayton, Tennessee. The Rhea County courthouse was constructed in 1890-1891 in the Romanesque Revival and Italian Villa style, with two large towers at either end of the building. The northeast tower is the clock tower with a central octagonal lantern below an open pavilion. The building was added to the National Registry of Historic Places in 1972, as it was the focal point of the Scopes Trial of the summer of 1925. William Jennings Bryan prosecuted the case for the state, alleging that Scopes violated a ban on teaching evolution in the classroom. Clarence Darrow unsuccessfully defended Scopes, who was charged with a fine of $100 at the conclusion of the trial.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0071_000051_000222_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12009</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12009/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
