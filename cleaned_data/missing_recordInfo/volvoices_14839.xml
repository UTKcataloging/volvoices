Part of the Tennessee Volunteers serving under General Coffee and General Jackson, King described several battles beginning December 23, 1814 through January 8, 1815. In that final battle, King said that the British were "shamefully whipped," taking much heavier losses than the Americans. He claimed that it "killed the British joy...to think that a parcel of raw militia, undisciplined Tennesseans, should best the chosen troops of England, who had fought so many successful battles in France and America now to be defeated by an equal force of raw Tennesseans and Kentuckians, supposed to be 10,000 each." The location at the top of the letter says "Bachelors` Hall, The Ladies Choice."</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0039_000050_000200_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A14839</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A14839/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
