   <note>These pictures offer a panoramic view of Centenary College in Cleveland, Tennessee. On the back of the first image is a drawing and description of a wedding dress as follows. The second best dress was light gray with train trimmed light blue frail velvet, was very elaborate... 2 Beaver hats with bloomes/white/black. Traveling dress was navy blue coat suit with train. Neglige red with train with blue velvet house shoes. Evening slipper black with black beads. Mrs. Edd Royal made this dress... udining table... in the center of a cut glass mirror with a vace on a lace cloth. It was very beautiful. Note the spelling on the words bloomes [blooms], negligee [negligee]and vace [vase]. The Lord is my Shepherd and I am the Truth and life is also written on the back of this photograph.</note>
