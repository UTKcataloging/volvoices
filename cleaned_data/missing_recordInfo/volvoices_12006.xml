   <note>2 tifs. The uniformed 1924 Rhett Central High School Football team pose and scowl for the camera on the school's stairs. The verso, typed in 1978, lists the team members "Top Row: Crawford Purser. 2nd Row: JOHN T. SCOPES (Coach), Henry (Honky) Jones, Luther (Luke) Welch, Edwin Williamson, Carroll (Flop) Tallent. 3rd Row: Charles (Pup) Hagler, Austin (Wig) Tallent, Verdman (Rat) Wells, Grady (Piggy) Purser, Clair Elsea. Bottom Row: Arch (Buck) Shalton, Charles Stokley, Jack Hudson, C.L. Locke, Dean Norman. 1978 - Following deceased: Jones, Williamson, Hagler, Roddy, Elsea, Stokley, Scopes." Scopes, after earning his law degree at the University of Kentucky, landed a job at the Rhea County High School coaching basketball and substituting for teachers in 1924. The Scopes trial and controversy erupted when Scopes taught evolution to his general science class in 1925. Scopes was fined $100 for violating the Butler act, which banned teaching evolution. The Butler Act was repealed in 1967.</note>
