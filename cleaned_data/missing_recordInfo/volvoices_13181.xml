   <note>This document appears to be a letter to Return J. Meigs dated July 23, 1813 composed by several Cherokee chiefs at the request of Pathkiller, the principal chief, to inform Meigs of the growing Creek civil war. The letter tells that the town of Tooquachee (Toocabatchee) in the Creek Nation, where four different tribes of Indians once held friendly conferences, has been taken from Creek chief Big Warrior and destroyed. While Big Warrior is considered a "friendly" Creek, the letter states that the majority of Creek Nation has gone against him to join the rebel party. The Cherokees indicate that they have information that one of the prophets partly responsible for the uprising has escaped to the Choctaw Nation. Included is a warning from Big Warrior to the Cherokees to arm themselves against the rebellious Creeks along their borders.</note>
