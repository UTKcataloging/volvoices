   <note>The letter relates the writer`s New Hamphire birth and his moving and settling in Fentress County, Tennessee, where he prospered from his farm and mill. It tells of a speech given by Horace Maynard in Fentress County before the outbreak of the war and the temper of the people in the community at the time. The letter then proceeds with a long detailed account of the writer`s wartime service with Union forces as a scout under General Thomas in Tennessee and Kentucky, involving many small instances of bravery and treachery and encounters with the enemy through four years of war. Records the mistreatment of the writer`s family and the burning of his farm by rebels and the hatred of him which is still strong in his community. Some events are written up and signed by those who eitnessed them. The letter is incomplete. Only 12 or the 27 pages remain.</note>
