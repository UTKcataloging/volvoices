   <note>The Mountain Branch of the National Home for Disabled Veterans was established in 1903, and the original construction planned 37 buildings including 8 barracks for 2500 men. Disabled Volunteer Soldiers living in the Home did not have serious injuries, and were expected to work during their stay according to their abilities. The Home contained a large farm with a greenhouse, producing vegetables and livestock for consumption. A fire department, jail, morgue and a zoo were all on site. Additionally, a baseball field and gazebo (used for concerts by the Branch Band) attracted local audiences. The project was completed in 1910. The images of the Branch include: Quartermaster Headquarters, Ice Manufacturing Plant, Stables, Hospital, Power Plant, The Machine, Carpenter, Paint and Tin Shop, a Mess Hall, The Promenade, Memorial Hall which was used as the theatre, and the Chapel.</note>
