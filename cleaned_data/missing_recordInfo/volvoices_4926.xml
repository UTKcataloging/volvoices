   <note>Mrs. M.B.C. Ramsey writes to her daughter, Mrs. E.A.R. Breck and relates the resignation of their pastor because he wished to preach to freed slaves and his congregation opposed this. She discusses the family`s plans to settle in Alabama and her expectations of their new home. She relays news from Uncle Arthur and his family, including his fears about Crozier`s remaining in Knoxville during Reconstruction and his family`s plans to return there. In the same letter, Mr. J.G.M Ramsey adds a note to their children, Margaret Jane, Lizzie, and Crozier. He reports that he has been suffering from rheumatism and expresses a wish that they could raise Henrietta`s two sons. He discusses the present low value of land and the future of politics in the country.</note>
