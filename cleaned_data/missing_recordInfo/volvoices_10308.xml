   <note>This piece of sheet music is included in a bound volume once owned by Tennessee resident, Miss Nora Gardner. It's cover has a handwritten inscription to "Miss N. Gardner from a "Union friend of T. Richards." The piece is "Dedicated to the United Democracy" and states that "The North and South have acted wrong" and urges the people to support their cause of keeping the pre-Civil War status quo.</note>
