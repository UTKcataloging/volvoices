   <note>This Newspaper clipping is from The Weekly Crescent of Livingston, Tennessee, which is reprinting news from the Fentress County Gazette. The last 3 paragraphs are about oil in Fentress County. Bob`s Bar well increased production to over twenty barrels a day. J. H. Compton, President of the Inter State Petroleum Company, owner of the well, and a party of eastern capitalists were expected to visit. They were contemplating the construction of a refinery in the area, and the editors expected "much good from their visit." Newspaper editor is touted as "The meanest white man in America."
