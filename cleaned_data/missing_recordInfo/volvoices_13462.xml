   <note>These pages are the original minutes detailing the construction of the new courthouse in Maryville, Blount County in October and November in 1906. The images are the first 17 pages of 39 pages of the minutes, recorded primarily by William A. McTeer. The Commission received bids from architects, and selected the Baumann Brothers of Knoxville, who bid for $35,000. The minutes also detail the purchase of the site for the courthouse. The project`s budget was not to exceed $50,000 and the Commission detailed the size of all the main rooms in their plans before calling for bids. The Commission included Colonel W.B. Townsend, W.B. Howard, Will A. McTeer, and John Huffstetler, Chairman, elected to replace Maj. Ben Cunningham when he resigned.</note>
