The image was captured by N.B. Bettison, photographer, from Bowling, Green Kentucky. The disclaimer reads: "Duplicates of this picture can be had at any time by ordering." The image is captioned by hand: "Elizabeth West Walton, mother, Lizzie Walton, wife of George Pickering, mother Louise (Jarrott), Paul Walton, Charles, Emma Cook (Davis) and Virginia." The estimated date is based upon another image of Elizabeth Walton in 1886, two years prior to her marriage.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0054_000050_000207_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11802</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11802/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
