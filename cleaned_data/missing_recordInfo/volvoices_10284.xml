This clipping is a poem entitled "Farewell to Yankee Doodle," which is a derogatory account of the North and its reasons for the Civil War as well as a call to the South for independence. The newspaper publisher is unknown, as is the year of publication. However, since this poem's content reflects the Southern attitudes regarding the issues of the Civil War, the creation date and publication dates are inferred from the range of 1861-1865.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000218_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10284</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10284/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
