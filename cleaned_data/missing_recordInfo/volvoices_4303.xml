Long and gloomy reflections on the state of their party in the Memphis district in which he refers to the Camilla Massacre and the Memphis riots, blames Nunn for splitting the Republicans, and is certain that their faction has done its duty. Feels that they must assure their political future by crushing the Bulletin and by making the Post the only organ of Republicanism in West Tennessee. Urges Eaton to use his influence with state and federal officials to bring this about.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0012_000053_000272_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A4303</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A4303/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
