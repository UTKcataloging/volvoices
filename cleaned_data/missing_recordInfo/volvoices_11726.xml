James' father died when he was six; after that time James and his sister, Emma, were educated in boarding schools. When James was ten he attended Saint Andrews School for Mountain Boys, near his mother's summer cottage in Sewanee, Tennessee. The first photograph is most likely of James, his mother, Laura Tyler Whitman Agee, his grandmother Whitman, his sister Emma and his uncle, Hugh Agee. The second image on the beach is probably of James, his mother, cousins and uncle. The third image is likely James, his cousins and aunt.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0023_000067_000201_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11726</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11726/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
