   <note>These are 2 slides from the collection titled, " Nancy Ward gravesite dedication". Nancy Ward (1738-1822) was a Cherokee woman of great ability. Her name was Nanyi-hi. She was known among the white settlers as Nancy Ward because, for a time, she was married to Bryant Ward. (they had a daughter) She achieved the position, Beloved Woman, an office of importance in the Cherokee Nation and impressed many settlers by her actions and negotiations. In the first slide is Governor Ray Blanton (suit, on left) and on right side is Secretary of State (TN): Joe C. Carr. (who held officein the 1970's)</note>
