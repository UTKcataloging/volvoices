Meigs to John Armstrong, the Secretary of War. This letter was written after the Creek War of 1813 had begun, and Meigs informs Armstrong that he had supplied the Cherokee with blankets and other supplies in compensation for their cooperation against the Creeks. Meigs also explains his philosophy regarding working with the Cherokee; he believes that keeping them dependent on the US for support and assistance is beneficial to both the US and the Cherokee.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0012_000570_000229_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13330</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13330/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
