   <note>2 tifs. A cancelled check issued by the Bank of Celina, paid to the Gainesboro Telephone Company for fifty cents, from Celina, Tennessee on October 1, 1907. The check is issued for "September toles" and was check number 14 for Geo. [George] W. Stephens. The note is in black ink with ornate text and many blanks for filling in amounts. The verso is stamped three times. The first in blue ink reads "Pay American National Bank, Or Order, Sparta, Tennessee, The Gainesboro Telephone Company. Incorporated." The second blue stamp reads "Pay to the order of Fourth National Bank. Nashville, Tenn. American Nat'l Bank of Sparta, Tenn." A faint red stamp reads " Pay Any Bank or Banker Fourth Nat'l Bank Oct 5 ---- Nashville, Tenn. J.T. Howell, ----." The Celina was founded on March 2, 1895 in Clay County, Tennessee, and continued operation into the 21st century.</note>
