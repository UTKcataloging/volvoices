Inscribed on the cover is "Presented to NOra E. Gardner by Eliza Gooding, 'My Sorority,' Columbia, Sep. 1, 1861." There is no date of publication; however, the date of 1860 was inferred from another piece of sheet music in the same bound volume belonging to Miss Nora Gardner of Tennessee.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000274_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11498</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11498/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
