   <note>This document consists of 52 pages of the entire 142 page document that consitutes the Waterford vs. Baker case. The Waterford vs. Baker case was filed by Adam Waterford in Chancery Court in Rogersville, Tennessee in 1830. The case details Waterford`s efforts to prevent Baker both from securing as payment for debts title to lands held in trust by a third party, and from retaining possession of a slave previously owned by Waterford. The case began in 1830 and continued through 1841. Both Waterford and Baker died before the final disposition of the case. Adam Waterford was born a slave during the late 18th century but was emancipated prior to March 1817. On May 26, 1811 he and Betsey Day, described in contemporary records as "people of colour," were married in Tazewell County, Virginia. The Tazewell County Court granted Waterford permission to settle within that county, "his being an emancipated slave and a man of extraordinary merit." In April 1817 he was residing in Sullivan County where he purchased 206 acres of land from Adam Miller.</note>
