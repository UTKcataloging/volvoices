   <note>Pomeroy desires Eaton`s help in replacing Gaw as civil engineer in charge of Tennessee River development in Chattanooga. Gaw is only moderately qualified and is a Copperhead. Weitzel is in charge of these appointments but would be influenced by his superiors in Washington. Reminder that the writer has had experience in work on canals, rivers, and railroads. Will attend a meeting for the reorganization of their party in Nashville.</note>
