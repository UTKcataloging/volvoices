   <note>Expresses alarm that Boyle, who has allowed rebels to register in the writer`s county, remains in office as registrar. Claims that Holt was to have replaced Boyle, cites the disunity of their party on this matter and the damage it is doing them. Proposes ways of nullifying the registration and asks that his letter be shown to Governor Brownlow. Makes known his own desire to receive an appointment.</note>
