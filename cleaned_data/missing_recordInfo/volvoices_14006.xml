   <note>This document is a letter written by Elizabeth Chester to her daughter, Mary Jane Chester, on March 26, 1841. In the letter, Elizabeth discusses social events taking place in Jackson, such as marriages and parties, as well as events taking place with the people in their family. She asks her daughter not to ride on horses because she could get injured, and to always tell them the truth because they need to trust her while she is away from home.</note>
