   <note>This document is a letter written by James King to his wife dated October 21, 1835. King writes the letter from Memphis, Tennessee, where yellow fever has killed many of its residents and has caused others to flee the city. King writes of his good health and of hers, certain business matters involving himself, and states that the fever will soon be gone so that Mrs. King can return home. King speaks of many of their friends in the city that have become ill, or were ill due to the fever. He concludes by wishing her and their family continued health and a prompt reunion.</note>
