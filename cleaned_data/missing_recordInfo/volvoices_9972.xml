   <note>This is a flyer announcing the opening of Cumberland University, Lebanon, TN. There was to be a reception on the first Monday of September. It announces the literary, and law faculty, presumably the only two departments present at the school`s inception. Tuition is from 15 to 35 dollars per session for the literary department, and 50 dollars per session in the law department. Buildings had not been erected at the time of this flyer, but were scheduled for completion the following year.</note>
   <note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note>
