   <note>These are two images of aircraft at the Tri-City Airport in Sullivan County, Tennessee. The airport was conceived in 1934 to serve Bristol, Johnson City and Kingsport, Tennessee. Construction started in 1935 on a 323 acre site in Sullivan County. Upon completion in 1937, the airport had two small runways, a terminal building and an aircraft hangar. The first commercial aircraft that landed at the Tri-City Airport was an American Airlines DC-2. American Airlines was a leader early in the industry, but discontinued service to area in 1952.</note>
