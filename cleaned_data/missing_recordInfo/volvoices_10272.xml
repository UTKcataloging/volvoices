It is inscribed in pencil at the top of the cover page to "Miss Nora L Gardner from an 'Acquaintance' Evansville Ind 4th July 1863." The song laments a lost love from the woman's point of view and says to "Go, and smile upon another, Kneel and worship at her shrine, Win her heart: then coldly break it, As you would have broken mine."</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000220_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10272</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10272/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
