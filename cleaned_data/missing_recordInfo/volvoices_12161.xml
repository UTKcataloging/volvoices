   <note>2 tifs. A sepia toned photograph of Martin College in Pulaski, Tennessee. The card shows the campus grounds and the side of a collegiate building with another building hidden by the trees. Below the image "Campus Views, Martin College, Pulaski, Tenn." is written. The verso states that the card was printed by E. C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, and sent on a green one cent stamp featuring Washington's profile. The card was sent to Mrs. Leila Moore of Shelbyville, Tennessee and the message reads "May you have many more 'Happy Birthdays' is our wish. Susie and Lura Bridges." Martin College was founded due to the 1870 endowment of Thomas Martin upon his death. Martin college in Pulaski was chartered in 1872, and built in 1873. The grounds originally covered eight acres and cost $30,000. The school operated as four-year boarding college for women, and became Martin college in 1905 after it became property of the Methodist Church. In 1938 it became co-educational; was integrated in 1966 and accredited in 1995.</note>
