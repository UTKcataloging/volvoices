Lenoir to his brother-in-law Charles F. Welcker in Roane County, Tennessee. Lenoir writes to inform Welcker that Ellick, a slave he had hired from Welcker was found to have left his clothes behind in a hollow log as he had seemingly departed from Lenoir`s property. Lenoir states that he wishes to flog Ellick, but asks Welcker his opinion on the matter.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0023_000068_000237_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A14317</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A14317/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
