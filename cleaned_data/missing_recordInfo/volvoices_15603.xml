   <note>Isham Harris published this handbill in 1863 in Chattanooga as Governor of the Confederate state of Tennessee. It calls on people to vote in an election to elect a governor, members of the General Assembly and Confederate Congressional representatives on the first Thursday in August. He writes of the duty of citizens to cast their vote despite "the attempt of arbitrary and lawless power" to prevent it. The letter explains the law pertaining to elections, and outlines the means by which the vote will take place and instructs County Courts or sheriffs to send the sealed votes by a military force to either the Speaker of the Senate or the Secretary of State in Athens, Tennessee. A copy of an act passed on March 13, 1862 detailing number of representatives each county will have in the Tennessee Confederate state legislature. Edwin A. Keeble, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Edward S. Cheatham, Speaker of the Senate.</note>
