   <note>This piece is included in a bound volume that once belonged to Tennessee resident, Miss Nora Gardner. In fact, her name ("Nora Gardner") is inscribed in pencil on the cover page of this particular piece of music. The last page of the piece is a manuscript page that is labeled with the number 006188-SMVOL. Although the plate number for this last page indicates that it should be p. 5 of "Turkish Galop," it appears to be musically unrelated to that piece. This, plus the fact that the original owner saw the need to furnish a replacement for "Turkish Galop" in holograph, suggests a publisher's error.</note>
