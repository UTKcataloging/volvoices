   <note>This piece has a German translation included. A small publication, it has "Compliments of G.A. Bittrolff [amp] Co." printed on the cover, and on the back five advertisements are listed - a photographer, jeweler, dry goods and shoes. No publication date is listed, but as it is included in a bound volume of sheet music that belonged to Miss Nora Gardner of Tennessee that has sheet music from the period of 1860 through 1866, the publication date has been inferred to be 1864.</note>
   <note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note>
