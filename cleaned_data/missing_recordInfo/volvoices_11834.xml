Three images taken during the American bicentennial of the Polk County Courthouse in Benton, Tennessee. The courthouse was designed in the Art Deco Style and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 for its architectural and engineering significance. The third image is a closer view of the memorial erected by the American legion. The sculpture is engraved "Dedicated to the memory of the men of Polk County Tenn.
