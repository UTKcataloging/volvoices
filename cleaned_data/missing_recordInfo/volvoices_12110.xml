The stadium was also known as the Stone Castle, and its construction was completed in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration. The Castle was constructed of limestone quarried from nearby Beaver Creek. It holds approximately 6,000 people and is still used by the football team of Tennessee High School. The Stone Castle, in the style of Medieval Gothic architecture, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The first and second images depict the building's facade, while the third shows a crowd gathered in the stands by the football field.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0085_000050_000218_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12110</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12110/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
