Jubilee history:(from,www.memphiskemetjubilee.com/history) "Memphis and various social organizations celebrated its success in the cotton industry during the early 1900s. In March 1934, Dr. R.Q. Venson, then a dentist on Beale Street, took his wife's nephew to view the Cotton Carnival Parade. When his nephew pointed out that . . . the Negroes were horses, Dr. Venson decided to request that Negroes be allowed to participate fully in the parade. His request was not taken seriously during this time of segregation, and he was challenged to organize a Negro festival. Dr. Venson knew that Memphis' celebration of the cotton industry needed to be more. If it were not for the contributions of African slaves and later contributions of African Americans, the cotton industry could not have become the success it was then, and as we know it today.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0114_000050_000202_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12259</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12259/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
