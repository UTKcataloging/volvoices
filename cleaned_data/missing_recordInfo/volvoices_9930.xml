A ticket for a "Farewell Concert" of the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University in January, 1875. The concert was held in the Masonic Hall on Monday January 11, 1875 at 8 p.m. and sponsored by the American Missionary Association. The ticket does not specify a location, but the Masonic Hall may have been in Nashville, Tennessee for the singers gave their final performance in their hometown before embarking upon a second tour of Europe. The singers first toured the North in 1871, and then toured Britain in 1873 as a part of their fundraising efforts. Their second tour in 1875 began in Britain, then moved on to Germany and ended in 1878 when the group disbanded. A new choir was formed in 1879 and toured internationally in the 1880s. This document has faint markings which may be the signature of the ticket holder, or a note.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0093_000050_000204_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9930</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9930/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
