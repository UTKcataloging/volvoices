   <note>This is the will of James Wright, a weaver of Davidson County, written on March 26, 1816 and recorded on December 22, 1816. The will states that Wright was "sick and weak in body, but of perfect memory." He asked to be buried as a Christian and bequeathed the use of his land, Negroes, and farming equipment to his beloved wife Patty for "so long as she does remain single." The slaves were later to be divided among his four daughters, and the land and farm equipment among his six sons. The will further detailed other bequests and named his wife Patty and son George as executors of the will. The will was probated May 10, 1852. H.R. Cheatham certified and signed the document.</note>
