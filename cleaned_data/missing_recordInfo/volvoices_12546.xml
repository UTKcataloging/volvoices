He implores Eaton not to make this information public at the present time. Stilwell describes other personal financial losses through carelessness and thanks Eaton for his offer of help in educating Stilwell`s son. He discusses the current gloomy outlook for Republicans in Tennessee, with news of an increasingly active Ku Klux Klan and the registering of all former rebel soldiers and officers in his county.
