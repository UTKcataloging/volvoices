   <note>Letter from Alfred Stewart to General George H. Thomas that says that Stewart has served more than two years of a ten-year sentence for house burning, but states that the house is still standing. Convinced that he was convicted due to "the prejudice of the rebels..." Pleads that he is far "from my home and have A wife and two Little children they are left on the charity of the people. I am among strangers..." After the signature he has written "colored". Contains note, dated January 2, 1868, from George H. Thomas recommending to Gov. Brownlow that the petititoner`s case be favorably considered.</note>
