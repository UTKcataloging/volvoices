   <note>J.G.M Ramsey authorizes his son, Crozier, to make a decision concerning Breakbill`s offer to buy the Mecklenburg property, telling him to try to get $5000 for it. He discusses Mecklenburg at length, its historic value, its sentimental meaning to the family, and its destruction during the war. He mentions his just and unjust debts. He describes Sue Ramsey`s recent wedding. He reports that he and his wife are unsure about their future plans but remaining in North Carolina seems to have more merit than returning to Knoxville. He refers briefly to other family members. Mecklenburg is the name of J.G.M. Ramsey`s property in east Tennessee which he abandoned due to his loyalty to the South in the Civil War.</note>
