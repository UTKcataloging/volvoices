Frank Bell November [date unclear]" At the bottom of that page is another handwritten note "Compliments of J. Frank Bell." The hymn has the lyrics in both English and French and is a patriotic cry for freedom from tyranny. No publication date is listed. However, this piece was published during the span of 1845 through 1856, which has been inferred from the years during which the publisher operated under the specified name and location, as listed in the Handbook of Early American Sheet Music 1768-1889 by Harry Dichter and Elliott Shapiro (Dover, 1977).</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000213_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10293</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10293/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
