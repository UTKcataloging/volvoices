The first black and white photograph is of an end of a boiler, stamped with the inscription "Eureka Cotton Mills/ 1916/ Englewood Tenn/ Built by The Walsh and Weidner Boiler Co/ Chattanooga Tenn". The second image is of the side of the cotton mills building, with dilapidated windows on the arched brick facade. From the mid-19th century into the first half of the 20th century, Eureka Cotton Mills was a driving force in the economy of Englewood, Tennessee. Around 1915 the town of Englewood had a labor force of 300, and neighborhoods of mill houses were built in the area. The Great Depression forced the closure of Eureka Cotton Mills, but the remains of the factory are still on the site.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0083_000050_000221_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12082</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12082/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
