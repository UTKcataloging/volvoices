Warneken Tobacco Prizing House in Clarksville, Tennessee. Tobacco was packed in these warehouses. The houses were referred to as "prizing" based upon an early definition of prize, meaning "to press, force, or move with a lever." Clarksville at the turn of the century was heavily involved in the tobacco industry and remained a dominant force in tobacco until the mid-1900s.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0056_000050_000206_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11868</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11868/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
