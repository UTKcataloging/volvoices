   <note>This song tells of a wanderer who cannot forget his love. This was one of ten songs that were part of a publication called "Frendships Offering Beautiful Songs by Various Authors" and included in a bound volume that once belonged to Tennessee resident, Nora Gardner. On the back of the last page, is a hand-written lyrics to a song entitled "I have no Mother, how I'm weeping" and dated "Oakland, Tenn Sept. 2nd, 1871." No publication date is listed. However, this piece was published in 1860, which has been inferred from the year during which the publisher operated under the specified name and location, as listed in the Handbook of Early American Sheet Music 1768-1889 by Harry Dichter and Elliott Shapiro (Dover, 1977).</note>
   <note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note>
