Gore lauds Roosevelt`s recommendation for a National Service Act, which would allow the government the ability to draft Americans into the war effort work force. The congressional representative also comments on Congress` partisan divisions over other domestic concerns, such as budget use, the soldier voter bill, and the railroad wage dispute. Gore announces his induction into the United States Army and the President`s request that the Tennessean remain in Congress where he may best serve his country.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0039_000059_000213_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A8504</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A8504/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
