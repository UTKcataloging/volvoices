   <note>1 tif. A letter written on March 22, 1900 from P.H. Walker in Cleveland, Tennessee to Judge J.B. Frazier in Chattanooga, Tennessee which details Walker`s opinions about world events at the turn of the century. The letter reads, "Dear Sir, Your favor of yesterday has been read in which you inquire how I stand on the great political questions now before the American people. I hasten to let you know. I am in favor of the Chicago platform in full and favor giving the Fillipino [sic] independence and protection as soon as they can establish a stable government. I favor our government building the Nicaraguan canal without delay. I am opposed to a large standing army, Imperialism, Trusts, and the Puerto Rican tariff bill. Very truly, P.H. Walker." The letter was written on lined paper imprinted with Walker`s name and Cleveland, Tennessee.</note>
