   <note>This copy of the State of Frankland Constitution was published in 1786 by Francis Bailey of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The State of Franklin was an autonomous United States territory created, not long after the end of the American Revolution, from territory that had been ceded by North Carolina to the federal government. It later become part of the state of Tennessee. Franklin was never officially admitted into the Union of the United States and existed for only four years. This copy of the Constitution is now missing both the front cover and the back page. The image of the front cover is from a copy made of the original and the image of the last page is from a typed transcription of the original.</note>
