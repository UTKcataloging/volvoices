A postcard of the Giles County Courthouse in Pulaski, Tennessee sent from Pulaski, Tennessee to Louisville, Kentucky. The black and white photograph of the building shows a street lined with cards in front of a renaissance revival style courthouse, with a colonnaded clock tower atop the building. The entrance is framed with corinthian columns, and the facades of the building are brick arches that frame square windows. The first courthouse was built in 1811, and due to fire the building had to be reconstructed three times. The courthouse was re-built in 1859 by the George Moore and Sons company, and cost nearly $30,000 to complete. It stood through the American Civil War, but suffered much damage. It was constructed again in 1908 at a cost of $133,000. The courthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The verso reads: "Tuesday AM, Rain all the way thru Nashville. Stopped for the night at Columbia, Tenn. About 50 mi. south of Nashville. Had a nice room in Tourist home. Good luck so far. Love Ada and Ray. Sent to Mrs. C. Kelley and Dorothy in Louisville, KY."</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0096_000050_000207_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12134</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12134/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
