   <note>2 tifs. A colored photograph of the Martin College for Young Ladies in Pulaski, Tennessee. The card features one of the school's buildings, in the Beaux-Arts style. Below the image the message "Do wish I could be with you. [unknown]...this time." The card was sent to Mrs. T.A. Abernathy of Memphis, Tennessee. There is no room for a message on the back, with the time stamp Pulaski, Tennessee May 7, 4 pm, 1907. It was printed by the TC co. of Chicago. It was sent on a green one cent stamp featuring Benjamin Franklin. The college was founded due to the 1870 endowment of Thomas Martin upon his death. Martin college in Pulaski was chartered in 1872, and built in 1873. The grounds originally covered eight acres and cost $30,000. The school operated as four-year boarding college for women, and became Martin college in 1905 after it became property of the Methodist Church. In 1938 it became co-educational; was integrated in 1966 and accredited in 1995.</note>
