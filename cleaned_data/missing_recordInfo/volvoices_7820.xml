Chester of Jackson, Tennessee. This convention followed one the previous October in Norfolk, Virginia. One of its purposes was to secure the "cordial and active co-operation" of people in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys to build trade with Europe, in a spirit of "generous rivalry" with the North-Atlantic Cities. Another purpose was to discuss the necessity of a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean over a route that was unobstructed all year. Additional topics were the leveeing of the Mississippi river and immigration. Included with this invitation are suggestions for how many delegates different entities should send and Robert Chester`s delegate badge.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0028_000050_000239_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7820</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7820/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
