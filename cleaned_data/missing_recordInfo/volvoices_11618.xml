   <note>3 tifs. Two images of classes of Maryville Polytechnic School. The first image is of the primary school students, and the second is of all the girls in the school from elementary through high school. The Maryville school system was established in 1900, with schools constructed in 1911. The Maryville Polytechnic school operated out of the Freedman's institute, and the building was demolished in 1938. The students are dressed in school uniforms consisting of white shirts, ties and plaid pants or skirts. The verso of the image reads "Girls of Maryville Polytechnic School -- Elementary through High School. Headed by Prof. and Mrs. Charles William Henry/ Martha Henry daughter/ 3rd row, 3rd from right edge/ YW@a 7 1/2 x 2 1/2/ 133 cap/ 767."</note>
