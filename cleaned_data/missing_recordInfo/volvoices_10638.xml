It is dedicated "To the Gallant Captain Semmes, His Officers, and Crew and to the Officers and Seamen of the C.S. Navy" The line "To death we will defend her; Facing the foe, down, down we'll go, But still cry 'No Surrender!'" is indicative of its demise - its only loss was its last - sunk by the USS Kearsarge.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000295_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10638</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10638/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
