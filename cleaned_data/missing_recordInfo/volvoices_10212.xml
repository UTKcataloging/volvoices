   <note>This piece of sheet music is included in a bound volume once belonging to Miss Nora Gardner, a Tennessee resident. This song is "A Beautiful Duet for Two Soprano Voices" and the lyrics are a sad reminiscence of "the land far away." On the back of the last sheet, a handwritten note in pencil reads "If Miss Nora ever peruses these lines let her remember those beautiful soul inspiring songs with which she favored me tonight and accept my my [sic] sincerest thanks which in my fervor I was so negligent as not to offer. Your truly. --- March 15, 1865."</note>
