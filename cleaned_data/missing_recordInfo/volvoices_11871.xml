   <note>This map of the Clinchfield Railroad Company's connections is printed on the back of the company's letterhead. The letter is likely from L.H. Phetteplace, General Manager in Erwin, Tennessee to J. Fred Johnson in Kingsport, Tennessee. Letter reads: March 25, 1939 Mr. J. Fred Johnson, Kingsport, Tenn. Dear Mr. Johnson: Thanks for yours of the 14th with enclosure. This is the same gentleman who has undertaken to guide the people of various towns in East Tennessee during the last eight or ten years. He is so concerned about the welfare of the poor and needy and goes to such extremes in his efforts to convince people that he is right, that he is immediately distrusted. He is also dishonest, and this defect is almost immediately uncovered when he gets in action. I am better, thank you, and feeling fine. Glad to note that Mr. Dennis is coming down. The last few days has certainly made our gardens and flower beds look like spring. Unfortunately I have to take a trip west, leaving here tomorrow night for Chicago and also visit our outside traffic agencies in the west. With kindest regards, I am Yours sincerely, [illegible--most likely to be L.H. Phetteplace, General Manager]</note>
