   <note>Dedicated to "All Disconsolate Conscripts," this piece's alternate title is "How Are You, Conscript?" and is a "comic song" that relates how unpopular and unfair the Confederate draft was during the Civil War. "Presented to Miss Lee by Duan[illegible]" is inscribed in pencil on the top of the cover sheet, and after the alternate title are the words "very well I thank you." Included in a bound volume of sheet music owned by Miss Nora Gardner of Tennessee.</note>
