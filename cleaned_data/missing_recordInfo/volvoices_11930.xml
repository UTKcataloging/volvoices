   <note>Eleanor Roosevelt and her entourage visited the Mountain City branch of the National Home for Disabled Soldiers on Memorial Day, May 30, 1939. The parade in Johnson City on this day entertained the First Lady and a crowd in excess of 25,000. The images in this collection feature a female band in uniform marching through Johnson City; a group of sailors marching in the parade; an aerial image of a male band marching and playing along the route; a motorcade of nearly twenty motorcycles driving down a lane; a set up in front of a government building featuring children sitting on the lawn; an image of local government figures seated and talking; and three images of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, waving and visiting with members of the crowd. One verso reads: "Elinor Memorial Day Services; Boy Scouts, R.O.T.C. and Tenn State Guard. Estimated Crowd 25,000 for services."</note>
