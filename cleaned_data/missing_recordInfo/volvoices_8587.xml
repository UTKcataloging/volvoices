   <note>In a speech given in Decatur County, Tennessee, Congressman Albert Gore discusses his interest in farm policies and programs of the largely agricultural Tennessee. He explains his role in the Gore-Anderson Farm Bill and how that bill defeated the Brannan Plan, which Gore believes would have ruined the economic stability of the farming community. As a candidate for the United States Senate, Gore promises to serve his state and nation in a conscientious manner and contends that he will effectively represent farmers in Congress.</note>
