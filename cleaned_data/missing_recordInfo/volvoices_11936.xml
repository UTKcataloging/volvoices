   <note>An image of the band at the Mountain Home Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer soldiers, and pictured separately, the bandstand which was also used as a gazebo. The Mountain Branch's founder and patron, Congressman Brownlow was particularly dedicated to the Branch Band, writing leading companies to secure instruments and music for the players. The Mountain Home Branch's band was popular entertainment for local Johnson City residents on Sunday afternoons. This fourteen member version of the band was uniformed and included: drums, flute, two clarinets, a tuba, a sousaphone, three trumpets, two french horns, two trombones and a conductor.</note>
