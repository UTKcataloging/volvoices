Chester, on November 13, 1842. In the letter Mary Jane tells Robert of events going on in Columbia, Tennessee, where she is attending school at the Female Institute, and inquires about events happening at home in Jackson. She tells him how upset she is that he did not visit her when he promised, and she also speaks of their cousin`s new baby, visiting with Governor Polk, and the death of her mother. Mary Jane concludes the letter by asking him to bring her a black muslin when he comes to visit her.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0022_000069_000233_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13952</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13952/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
