   <note>Lewis discusses the possibility of reconstruction being extended to Tennessee, the retention of power by Republicans in the state government, and the lack of good leadership in their party. He wishes the passage of a bill which would bring reconstruction to the state. Lewis hopes that Butler and Stokes will not serve out their terms. He reflects on Trumbull and other conservative men in their party. He does not sanction the recent Republican convention in Nashville. Lewis writes of his unwilling work on the county committee, attempts to meet his debts, and hope for the judgeship.</note>
