He recounts Wendell Wilkie`s appearance before the Senate Committee and former presidential candidate`s approval of the bill. According to Gore, Wilkie supported "effective aid" which would allow Great Britain the ability to "keep open the North Atlantic passage as a supply line from this great continent of resources." The representative closes his address by countering Wilkie`s suggestion that the bill limit its assistance to Great Britain, Greece, and China. Gore believes that the United States should be "ready to act when and where necessary for [its] defense."</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0039_000059_000208_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A8532</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A8532/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
