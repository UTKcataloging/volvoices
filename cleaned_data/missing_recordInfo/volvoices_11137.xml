   <note>This is a yearbook of the Company 3468, TENN. TVA-36 in District C of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The front part of the yearbook is the same as in other yearbooks of the District, but the back pages contain photos and information pertaining to this particular company. There are images of District C company projects such as a model home constructed by TVA-44 in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. A short company history accompanies group photographs of the C.C.C. workers and officers. There are also several photographs of the camp itself, as well as activities of the C.C.C. enrollees, including woodworking and arithmetic classes, dances, and photos of "camp characters" like the Best Sport, Best Worker, Best Athlete, Most Popular and Chow Hound.</note>
