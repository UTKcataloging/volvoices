   <note>This piece of sheet music is included in a bound volume that belonged to Tennessee resident, Miss Nora Gardner. This piece is "from the Songs of the Legends and Traditions of Ireland" and is arranged for the Guitar. It seems like an Irish variation on popular fairy tales involving mythical ladies luring unsuspecting people to their deaths. The creation date of 1838 is questionable. This piece was published during the span of 1840 through 1855, which has been inferred from the years during which the publisher operated under the specified name and location, as listed in the Handbook of Early American Sheet Music 1768-1889 by Harry Dichter and Elliott Shapiro (Dover, 1977).</note>
   <note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note>
