Their most successful years were after World War II when many veterans returned to finish their high school edcuation. This copy was issued Feb 14, 1967, when the school closed. The property was sold, and the proceeds given to David Lipscomb College for the establishment of a scholarship fund for African-American students. Joe C. Car was the Secretary of State of Tennessee at that time.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0091_000050_000200_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9966</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9966/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
