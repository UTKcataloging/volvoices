Inscribed on the cover: "Presented to Nora by her dear [ ] Laura Belle the day school broke up, Feb. 17th, 1862." No publication date is listed. However, this piece was published during the span of 1856 through 1862, which has been inferred from the years during which the publisher operated under the specified name and location, as listed in the Handbook of Early American Sheet Music 1768-1889 by Harry Dichter and Elliott Shapiro (Dover, 1977). This composition is part of a bound volume of sheet music that once belonged to Miss Nora Gardner, who was a Tennessee resident.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000264_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11478</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11478/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
