   <note>2 tifs. Two photographs of cooks during the construction of the main line of the L and N Railroad near McGhee, Tennessee. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad (the L and N Railroad) was chartered in 1850 and operated as the primary Southern railroad for over 150 years. Although the rail had merely 180 miles of track when it began, extending from Louisville, Kentucy to Nashville, Tennessee, the system comprised over 7,000 miles at its completion in 1982. The second image shows a tent which may have been used as a dining hall for the workers on the rail.</note>
