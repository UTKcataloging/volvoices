Gore argues that the health of the United States` international trade activity depends upon the business of transoceanic countries, not fellow North American nations. From a militaristic standpoint, the congressional representative believes that control of the seas is imperative to the survival of his country. Thus, Great Britain, America`s "partner in naval control" needs to be protected from the aggressor, and since the Neutrality Act "forbids [American] ships from going to the ports of Great Britain," Gore strongly suggests that the law should be repealed.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0039_000059_000209_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A8527</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A8527/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
