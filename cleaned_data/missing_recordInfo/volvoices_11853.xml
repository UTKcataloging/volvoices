Two images of the blackened ground and gaseous vapors of the smelting mines at Copperhill, Tennessee. Both images depict the refinery in the backrground, and the second image shows the raw steel and materials used in the mines. In the 1870s the mines at Copper Basin began to fail due to a lack of transportation and a decline in the quality of ore. However, improvements in transportation over the next twenty years led to rapid growth in the area. Eventually the area's industry shifted to sulfuric acid, which was used to smelt copper. In 1904 the pyritic process for copper smelting was invented, which eliminated the need to open roast the ore. In 1961 the Copper Basin aded a fluid-solids roaster to reduce pollution and in 1992 a new sulfur burner was installed to replace the smelter. Acid production at Copperhill ended in 2000.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0055_000058_000204_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11853</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11853/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
