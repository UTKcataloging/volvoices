The Mountain Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers in Johnson City, Tennessee housed a hospital with four wards. The hospital at this time was used to care for minor injuries, and was intended more as an infirmary. The Branch could house nearly 4,000 soldiers and was self-sufficient, even including amusement for the veterans including a baseball field and a zoo.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0061_000050_000205_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11919</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11919/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
