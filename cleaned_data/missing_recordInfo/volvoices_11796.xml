   <note>This postcard illustration depicts an African-American family working to load tobacco onto a horse-drawn cart. It was mailed to Mr. Sam Boone of Clarksville, Tennessee by someone named Myrtle. Tobacco was the main source of industry for Clarksville at the turn of the 20th century, and it remained one of the country's largest exporters until the 1940s. The note alludes to the train, which was another of Clarksville's sources of income. The note reads: "You may expect me on the T.C. at 5 o'clock Friday. Am at N--y's and am ready to go to Trenton to meet Maude and Miss Kellie. Hope You are feelling fine. Myrtle."</note>
