It was reprinted from The Constitutionalist, described as a "leading Federal Van Buren Organ in the Key Stone State" of Pennsylvania. The editorial describes anti-Southern, anti-Polk sentiment in choosing a Vice-President at the 1840 Democratic Convention in Baltimore. it speaks of the "political despotism of Tennessee and Alabama." The convention was unable to decide on a Vice Presidential candidate, but most went for Johnson, the man supported by this editorialist.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0054_000052_000200_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9418</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9418/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
