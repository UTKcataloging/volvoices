   <note>This article describes the final phase of the struggle for women`s suffrage, outlining the unsuccessful injunction against ratification in Tennessee, as well as the celebration in Washington following the official federal ratification. It names many of the women, such as Carrie Chapman Catt and Anne Dallas Dudley, who worked in Tennessee for the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The article contains two maps of the United States. The first is "The Suffrage Map in Early August, 1920," showing states which allowed women full suffrage, limited suffrage such as for primaries, or presidential or municipal elections, or no suffrage at all. The second shows "What Tennessee Did to the Suffrage Map," which was to grant full suffrage throughout the country.</note>
