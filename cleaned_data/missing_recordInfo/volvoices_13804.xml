   <note>This document is a letter written by C. Clay Balfrey to Edward E. Porter on November 11, 1850. In the letter, Balfrey mentions the fact that many people have been getting married and that marriage seems to be the popular thing to do at the time. He also mentions that Edward`s former landlord, a man named Nick Simmons, was shot in the back in a fight and has recovered. He concludes by saying that he wishes for Edward and himself to renew their friendship after some previous disagreements.</note>
