Above the title on the cover reads an printed inscription "To Madame Eliza N. CHurch, Columbia, Tenn." as well as an inscription handwritten in pencil at the top that reads "To Nora from Laura Jan 1863." There is no publication date. However, this piece was published during the span of 1858 through 1876, which has been inferred from the years during which the publisher operated under the specified name and location, as listed in the Handbook of Early American Sheet Music 1768-1889 by Harry Dichter and Elliott Shapiro (Dover, 1977).</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000217_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11365</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11365/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
