   <note>This song is an attempt at repairing relations between the North and the South following the American Civil War. Yet, the chorus reflects Southern pride when it states "We know that we were rebels, We don't deny the name, We speak of that which we have done, With grief, but not with shame." Interestingly, it is dedicated to "The People of the South." "Miss Nora from 'A Reb'" is inscribed in pencil on the front cover, and on the back page is an advertisement for new sheet music published by D.P. Faulds. This piece is included in a bound volumen of sheet music that was once owned by Tennessee resident, Miss Nora Gardner.</note>
