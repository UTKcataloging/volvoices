   <note>Three images of female Nazi collaborators in Vichy, France having their heads shaved on stage in front of a large crowd. French women who assisted or collaborated with Nazis were known as "femmes tondues." After World War II, head-shaving was a common punishment in France and Norway for female Nazi conspirators. The three images are from approximately 1939-1945. On the back of the first image, Warren has written: "These girls have just finished having their hair cut."</note>
