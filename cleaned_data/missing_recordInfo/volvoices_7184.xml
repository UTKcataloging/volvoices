Winton believes that he cannot receive a copy from Frazier because the document may be suppressed by Roman Catholic authorities. Also discusses a Senate bill affecting Indians that Winton would like Frazier to pay special attention to because he has been in communication with the Indian Rights Association. Includes reply by Frazier stating that the requested document has not been suppressed and he secured a copy for Winton.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0012_000144_000205_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7184</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7184/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
