   <note>Explains in an apologetic tone that, at Hamilton`s insistence, their party`s candidates for political office in Memphis have been decided upon. Lists the men and the offices each will seek. Reports that with the aid of the writer and his faction, L.B. was named a candidate. He and Gen. Smith will go to Washington and do what they can for their candidates and are also relying upon Eaton`s help. Mentions Hamilton`s attempt to control the party and his hopes of being elected to Congress or the governorship. Stresses that Nunn cannot be renominated without the aid of Gen. Smith and his friends.</note>
