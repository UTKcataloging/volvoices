   <note>This broadside proclaims that the 19th Amendment will never be ratified if Tennesseans guard their rights. It emphatically states that the Tennessee constitution probihits the ratification of any federal amendment until a new legislature is elected. It further claims that only the United States Supreme Court can declare that the Tennessee constitution is in conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Those who try to circumvent this provision are accused of being lawbreakers who should be impeached, and who are no better than the "BOOTLEGGER and the BOLSHEVIST." The message urges citizens to fight the suffragists attempts to override the Tennessee constitution by organizing mass meetings and circulating petitions.</note>
