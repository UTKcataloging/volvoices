This particular piece, a love song, has a cover that reads "Gems of English Song with accompaniment for the Piano Forte." Inscribed in pencil on the front cover are the words "Nora Gardner from Eliza Nov 15 1861." No publication date is listed. However, this piece was published during the span of 1855 through 1894, which has been inferred from the years during which the publisher operated under the specified name and location, as listed in the Handbook of Early American Sheet Music 1768-1889 by Harry Dichter and Elliott Shapiro (Dover, 1977).</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000230_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10224</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10224/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
