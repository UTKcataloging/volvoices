   <note>2 tifs. A postcard of the Giles County Courthouse in Pulaski, Tennessee. The black and white photograph of the building shows the tree lined lot spotted with cars. The building features with a colonnaded clock tower atop a four-sided temple style building, in the Beaux Arts design. The first courthouse was built in 1811, and due to fire the building had to be reconstructed three times. The courthouse built in 1859 by the George Moore and Sons company cost nearly $30,000 to complete. It stood through the American Civil War, but suffered much damage. The building was reconstructed in 1908 at a cost of $133, 000. The courthouse was added to the national register of historical places in 1983. The verso reads "Giles County Court House Pulaski, Tenn. Erected 1908 at cost of $133,000. Reached home at [unknown] and [unknown] Isabels put [unknown]...and regrettable error. Found lots to do will write later. Polly and my [unknown] happy to see us again. Our trip was all around a most pleasurable one and you just don't know how happy [unknown] to see you once again. Mrs A feel for you and yours.
