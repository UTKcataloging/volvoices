The Cherokee chief related that he surveyed local tribes and determined that most of the tribes he encountered were amenable to peace. He related that the Running Water People told the Glass, a Cherokee, that they had white prisoners. The Cherokee received a letter from Major Ore requesting the prisoners, and acknowledged that the tribe and the white people both have prisoners from the other side, and desired negotiations. The Cherokee also urged peace talks between the lower towns and the whites. The minutes are cut short when the speaker begins to relate a meeting between McKee and himself.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0017_000050_000208_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13547</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13547/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
