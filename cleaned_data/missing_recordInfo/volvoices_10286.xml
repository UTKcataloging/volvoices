This particular composition has an inscription on the front cover in pencil that reads "Nora Gardner Columbia Tenn Jan 30th 1863." The song is a Scotch ballad sung by Jenny Lind that tells of the courtship of a Scottish lass by her "Bonny Jocky" and the fact that she would not give in to his affection unless he married her.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000215_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10286</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A10286/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
