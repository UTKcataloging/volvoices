Stilwell in Humboldt, Tennessee to Gov. W. Brownlow in which Stilwell discusses recent election where states that the former Confederates did not vote for anyone "suspected of Unionism" and Black voters were induced to vote the way the former Confederates wished. Also discusses the Klu Klux Klan when he states that "negroes" are being shot, whipped, and driven off by the Klanm and complains that even visiting Northern Republicans must feign sympathy with the former Confederates. States that were a person to write and complain, as he has done, the result would be fatal, but he trusts Brownlow and expresses hope for Congressional action for protection.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0012_000103_000203_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A4601</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A4601/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
