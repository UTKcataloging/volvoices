   <note>January 10th letter: Reveals his capture by the enemy at Bristol and his ignorance of what crimes he will be charged with. Reports that he has been hospitalized for his rheumatism and treated kindly by the Union surgeon. News that Margaret Jane and her children are well. Urges his parents not to worry unnecessarily about him. February 1st letter: (Written on back of January 10th letter which he is forwarding to his wife) Assures her that any just court will set Crozier free as he is innocent of any dishonorable deed. Expresses confidence that peace will soon come and that they will weolcom it in spite of the outcome.</note>
