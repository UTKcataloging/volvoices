It emphatically refutes any connection to or payment from liquor interests, and claims that Susan B. Anthony herself had appealed to the United States Brewers` Association. The message threatens legal action against libel or slander, and lists the names of Judge John R. Tyson and Hon. Everett P. Wheeler as the general counsel to the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment and the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, respectively.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0015_000051_000209_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A15619</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A15619/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
