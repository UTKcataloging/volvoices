   <note>This postcard shows the exterior of Ed and Ann's Meadow Motel in the 1950s. At that time the hotel was located approximately a mile outside of Clarksville, Tennessee. It advertised its approval by AAA, and it membership in Courtesy Court, as well as its electric heat and telephones. The back of the postcard states that it had the newest 21 units in town, which were 100% Air-Conditioned, 15 with T.V. The motel was owned and operated by Mr. and Mrs. E. T. Jurka. The postcard was sent to Larry Goetsch of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin by his Uncle Alex. The note reads: "I am doing fairly good with my arm. This is a nice place. We drove 476 miles today. Uncle Alex."</note>
