The picture of Dr. Ellis on his horse, "Old Fred" was taken around 1915 at the "cut" between Embreeville and Bumpus Cove. The next picture is a portrait of Dr. Ellis in his later years. There are two pictures of Dr. Ellis practicing medicine in his office. He is treating a wounded knee, and the individual's face is not shown. Dr. Ellis also works with a small child in his office. The following three photographs are of Dr. Ellis' home and Dr. Ellis with a herd of cows. A re-creation of Dr. Ellis's office with his original furniture is located in the Museum of Mountain Home on the campus of the East Tennesse State University Medical Campus.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0061_000050_000234_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11962</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11962/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
