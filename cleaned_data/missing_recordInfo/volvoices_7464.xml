There are line drawings of the Vanguard, Sputnik, Atlas and Explorer satellites. There is a discussion of the effect of the launch of Sputnik on the the world, especially in the United States with regard to education, research and development into space exploration. The unit has a drawing about animals launched into space, contains a glossary of terms and a list of resources such as books and magazine articles for teachers. It also includes a list of the Social Studies Steering Committee and the teachers who had used the unit on an experimental basis.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0015_000065_000203_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7464</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7464/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
