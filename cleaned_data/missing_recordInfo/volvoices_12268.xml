However, because it is included in a bound volume of sheet music once owned by Miss Nora Gardner of Tennessee, and the range of dates of publication for the music included in this volume is from 1859 through 1866, the publication date of this piece is inferred to be 1864. Also, an advertisement is printed on the back of the cover sheet, which lists letters to the publisher that are all dated 1864.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0018_000054_000333_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12268</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12268/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
