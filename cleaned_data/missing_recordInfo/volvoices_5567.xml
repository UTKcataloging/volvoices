Dated February 27, 1783, it was written when Nashville was still called Nashborough. It speaks of the necessity of forming a government and instituting laws, as they are in a "barbarous and cruel" place. The reverse side holds what appears to be a draft of a legal document to enforce financial obligations, to be used in the District of Cumberland, State of North Carolina.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0028_000050_000201_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A5567</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A5567/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
