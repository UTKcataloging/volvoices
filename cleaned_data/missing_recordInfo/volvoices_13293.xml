Houston writes in response to some questions posed by Ross in regards to John Spears, an interpreter for the Cherokee who served as a delegate on behalf of the Arkansas tribe of the Cherokee. There is apparently a controversy involving Lewis Ross over whether or not Spears was entitled to receive a plot of land.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0012_000570_000237_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13293</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13293/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
