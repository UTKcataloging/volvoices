   <note>2 tifs. A color postcard of a statue of Sam Davis in front of the Giles County Courthouse. The statute features a sculpture of a young man standing defiantly and wearing a hat; it is inscribed with confederate flags and bears plaques with information about Davis and his execution. Davis was known as the "boy hero of the Confederacy," and was a private in the first Tennessee Volunteer infantry in 1861, and was captured in 1863 in possession of Union battle plans. In addition to the monument in Pulaski, there is a statue of Davis at the Tennessee state capitol in Nashville. The verso is blank but lists the information: "Sam Davis, a Confederate Scout of the Civil War, who, at age 21, was executed as a spy at Pulaski, Tenn., Nov. 27, 1863. The Giles County Courthouse in the background." It states the publisher as Southern Post Card Co., P.O. Box 306, Goodlettsville, Tenn.; Pastichrome by Colorpicture Publishers, Inc., Boston 15, Mass. U.S.A.; Color by R. E. Calonge.</note>
