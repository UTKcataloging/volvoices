   <note>A copy of a letter between Native American Chief, The Bloody Fellow, and Governor William Blount. The Bloody Fellow writes he spoke with the President regarding peace, and the encroachment upon his land. Fellow states that he spoke with Spain in attempt to treaty for peace, but is aware that this action upset Blount. Fellow argues that Blount`s people are encroaching upon his lands and threatening his people. Fellow wants Blount to force his people into peace and pay for the damages the Native Americans incurred.</note>
