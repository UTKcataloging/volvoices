Two representations of Maynard James, Sr. by Boyd Browder. The first is a charcoal sketch of James, and the second is a photograph of James in suit and tie. The representations, despite parallel subjects, convey different emotions, each best utilizing their medium. Boyd Browder was one of Knoxville's most important black photographer. He specialized in portrait and human photography, especially in the black community, and his studio, Browder Studios, was prominent during its time. Additionally, Browder was elected to the Knox County court from 1942-1946.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0073_000050_000241_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12063</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A12063/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
