   <note>A.H. Walker writing from Richland Valley, Weakley County, asks for advice on what to do about William H. Hornbeck of the Quorum Court. Hornbeck, as a member of the court in 1861, voted $4,000 for the Confederacy and a property tax to benefit "the families of rebel soldiers." Hornbeck joined Captain McCutchen "and went to Columbus, Ky. in search of Yankees." On December 8, 1866 Hornbeck took from Judge Lamarr the oath specified in the Franchise Law and was appointed an election judge. Walker wants him stripped of office. Also says that the Tax Collector has recently been shot. Says that without protection registering voters will be dangerous. Says that Emerson Etheridge used "his influence to prevent raising a company in his county." States that if his suggestions to Brownlow were known, his life would be endangered. Contains clerk`s notations.</note>
