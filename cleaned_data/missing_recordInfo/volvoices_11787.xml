   <note>This is a postcard to Mrs. M.L. Moodie in Pembroke, Kentucky from her daughter, printed circa 1910. The card features a "Cumberland River Steamer, Passing Through Clarksville, Tenn.". The Cumberland River Steamer was an excursion steamboat, and owned and operated by brothers Frank and Matt Gracey from Clarksville. The reverse reads: "Dear Mamma, Your letter came this morning. I have decided to go to Mabel's first. Will go Tuesday if you come on Monday. Sam says there is no cloverseed in town. He will see you Monday about ordering it for you. Hope you all are well. Lovingly, M.M.B."</note>
