Gore points out that a previous governmental investigation of the TVA found no evidence to support the Georgian`s claims. While he is in full support of expelling "subversive elements in the Government," Congressman Gore warns against making outrageous accusations about "innocent, patriotic American citizens."</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0039_000059_000200_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A8599</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A8599/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
