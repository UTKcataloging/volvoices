   <note>2 tifs. A postcard from the Homecoming celebration for the 100th Anniversary of Bedford county in September 1907. The card itself features a central crest with the poem, flanked by two photographs of Shelbyville Hotels, one founded in 1810 and the other in 1907. Below the crest and the images, the text invites readers to attend the Homecoming celebration. The text on the card reads "1807 1907. 'Mid pleasures and palaces, Tho' we may roam, Be it ever so humble, There's no place like home.' Shelbyville Hotel, "Holland House," 1810. Shelbyville Hotel, "the Dixie," 1907. 100th Anniversary of Bedford County Sept. 5-6-7, 1907. To be celebrated by a great Home-Coming To the Bedford County Fair, Shelbyville, Tennessee. You are Invited. H.B. Cowan, Sec'." Below the printed material there is a place for text, and the inscription reads "Wish you could be with us at this time. Please write soon. Mary." The verso is blank save for an elaborate crest stating "Post Card." There is a one cent Benjamin Franklin stamp at the top left, which was issued in 1907. The card has printing "This side is for the address." at the bottom. The address reads "Mrs. M.L. Creel, Rhea, Okla."</note>
