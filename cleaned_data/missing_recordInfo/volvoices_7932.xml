   <note>This is a divorce case between Walter E. McDaniels and Anna C. McDaniels. Walter McDaniels alleges that he is not in love with Anna and that she was defiant and "dictorial as old man Musselini himself." Walter McDaniels claims that his wife was violent and once meant to kill him with either a knife or poison. He also testifies that she is "wicked and malignant...and is unforgiving, like most of foreigners". Anna McDaniels was of Italian ancestry. Anna claims that her husband`s accusations are "wicked and untrue." In her defense, she denies all allegations, states that her husband left her destitute, and had a woman other than herself pose as his wife in order for him to enlist in the U.S. Navy.</note>
