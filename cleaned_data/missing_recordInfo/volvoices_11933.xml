The residents grew flowers in this greenhouse to provide for the infirmary and cemetery. The Home had a 250-acre farm and hired a full-time horticulturist to assist with the grounds. In the first image, two men work inside the greenhouse. The exterior of the greenhouse is featured in the second image and is labeled: Flower House.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0061_000050_000209_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11933</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A11933/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
