Dinsmoor was the U. S. agent to the Cherokees. Dinsmoor relates that a troop of Hightower Indians wish to meet with Robertson in peace talks. The Hightower wish to trade with the white people along the Cumberland and will provide an interpreter to the talks to facilitate peace and trading. Dinsmoor adds a note of apology about his not cautioning the Indians to kill, but he hoped that the desire of the Hightowers to trade would excuse him.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0017_000050_000212_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13532</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A13532/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
