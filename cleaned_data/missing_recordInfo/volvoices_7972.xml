Bayless and Mrs. R. P. Knight in Nashville praising Burns` vote for suffrage in August 1920. The first is a telegram from Bayless stating that Burns` name was enrolled on the list of those voting for suffrage in 1920. Burn was significant in the close vote of the 19th amendment by the Tennessee legislature because despite his original plan to vote against the amendment, he was persuaded to vote for suffrage and broke the tie.
