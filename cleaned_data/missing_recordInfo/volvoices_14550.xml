   <note>This letter was written as an court order to establish a smallpox hospital in Sumner County, Tennessee in 1865. The order stated that laws of state gave them the right to establish the hospital, thus, the court established a hospital. All persons with small pox were ordered to go to the hospital to prevent the spread of the disease. They were to be subject to the control of the hospital`s superintendent and had to obey any and all rules and regulations necessary for governing the hospital. The hospital was under the control of the court, and the expenses were a county charge paid out of the funds of the court.</note>
