A biographical sketch including a photograph in the Fisk University News of Mrs. Ella Sheppard Moore, a graduate and singer with the Jubilee Singers. Sheppard was the daughter of a slave who purchased his own freedom. She was trained in music in Cincinnati, while her father tried to escape re-enslavement. Ella studied at Fisk University for two years, and then taught at the college. She was a member of the Jubilee Singers who toured Europe and America. Later in her life she worked with her husband, Reverend George W. Moore, and gave lectures. The sketch also re-prints her writings about the Jubilee Singers. There are also three eulogies written in her praise in the paper, written by Talley and Moore.</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0093_000050_000202_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9934</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9934/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
