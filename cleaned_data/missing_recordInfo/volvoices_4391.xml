   <note>D.W. Peabody, Collector of Internal Revenue in Nashville, Tennessee describes the economy of the city as being prostrate and its people much opposed to African Americans and Northern investment. He discusses an attack upon Prosser and the good effect it produced on his standing and praises the Ku Klux Klan act passed by Congress which will prevent such violence. Peabody also gives an account of General Harrison`s death and expresses doubt about his successor. He regrets the difficulties Eaton experienced in obtaining favors for Saltmarsh, who is described as a scoundrel.</note>
