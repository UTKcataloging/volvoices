Dorsey, a soldier in the 33rd Ohio Infantry during the Civil War, writes to O.P. Temple discussing the South`s interest in the Civil War engagement of 1862 which came to be known as the Mitchel Raid, Andrews` Raid, the Great Locomotive Chase, and the Chattanooga Railroad Expedition. Dorsey, a Union survivor of the raid, is planning a trip to South to speak on the event. In Dorsey`s postscript he says that he has a "warm feeling for the southern people, prompted to some extent...that my parents were Virginians."</note><note>The University of Tennessee Libraries (Knoxville, Tennessee) is the digital publisher.</note><identifier type="local">TU:DLC:Filename:0012_000070_000351_0000</identifier><relatedItem><titleInfo><title>Digital Collection: The Growth of Democracy in Tennessee: A Grassroots Approach to Volunteer Voices</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><language><languageTerm type="code">eng</languageTerm></language><accessCondition type="use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/UND/1.0/">Copyright Undetermined</accessCondition><location><url access="object in context" usage="primary display">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A15774</url><url access="preview">https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A15774/datastream/TN/view</url></location></mods>
